[2:27] What is Adobe Illustrator?
Adobe Illustrator is part of the Adobe Creative Suite. And in recent years has become industry standard for creating vector artwork 
and the simple layout for print. 

We are going to be working with CMYK colors for the poster. Though, for the T-shirt design, we will need to stay within a budget and use
only Pantone colors that the printer requires. 

So we are going to explore how to incorporate pantones and CMYK swatches into our artwork.

In Illustrator, any objects that are created are made up of anchor points. This is a difference between Photoshop which is primarily pixel
based, and Illustrator which is primarily anchor based. 
These anchor points contain mathematical values which work to create vector shapes.
- [15:27] anchor handles
Now, vector paths that contain curves will also have anchor handles values
It's these handles that carry the information which determines the curve values. 
and each anchor will only ever have two handles.
